# Early Game (Until LV)

### When you spawn, you will die. There are no dirt blocks in the entire world. Fortunately, your death will spawn a gravestone with dirt under it.

# Welcome to the **Dirt Age**.

Continue dying until all spawn randomization locations (roughly a 22x22 square) have graves/dirt on them.

![](../assets/images/gog-night-time-graves.png)

Ok, now you can walk around without dying instantly on spawning! You have two tasks now:

1. Remove all graves. These will spawn skeletons (including infernals) during the night, which will obliterate you at this stage. They do this regardless of player distance, unlike normal mob spawning.
2. Graves spawn at `y=4`, which means you have just enough space to create tunnels under the platform to farm dirt. You only need 1 block of space and shift walking to farm a 3 wide swath of dirt.

![](../assets/images/gog-mining-dirt.png)

Once youâ€™ve completed these two tasks, spawn proof the main island with draconic place. For this you can use any item, like raw human flesh or heads (youâ€™ll have plenty by this point from farming graves and being destroyed by infernals).

![](../assets/images/gog-draconic-place.png)

From there, you have two options. You can find a biome with the 'magic' tag, said tags can be found on the biomes page of the GTNH wiki, and make a spawn area, be it flat, or enclosed 1 by 1 by 2 cells. It should eventually yield a pech. Pech's can be traded with, but the specific one you want is the Pech Forager, as it can trade you a silverwood or greatwood sapling, thaumium tools, and rarely, a golden apple. Pechs accept any item with the lucrum aspect, such as gold coins and gear, gems, some dungeon loot, and music discs. That only secures wood, however. The next part gets you villagers. (The raw ore clusters traded by the pechs are also very worthwhile to keep, though feel free to trade gold ones back. The iron, tin, silver, and lead, however, are very useful! Iron, tin, and copper are self-explanatory, but the silver ones can be used for Solar boilers, which are very powerful, especially upgraded, and lead ones can be used for good pipes, either directly, or as potin, which can save you one copper and tin.)

Your next goal is to build a manual skeleton grinder using graves. You want to obtain two things - a **splash potion of weakness**, and a **non-enchanted golden apple**. These will be used to cure a zombie villager, who will give you your sapling trade, if you haven't acquried one already. Unfortunately, these are from player kills only, so we need to do some careful design.

The first important fact is that draconic place items have obsidian-level blast resistance. This will be handy when building grinder setups.

![](../assets/images/gog-raw-human-meat.png)

For a skeleton grinder setup, this is the design we used, allowing us to hit the skeletons from below:

![](../assets/images/gog-skeleton-grinder-v1.png)

Of course, we donâ€™t have stone slabs in world and using dirt is annoying due to the cost to obtain, so this is how ours looked in world using draconic place:

![](../assets/images/gog-draconic-skeleton-grinder.png)

Eventually, you will acquire your splash weakness potion and golden apple. Build a separate spawning area so you can pull out a zombie villager, then use the items on him to convert him back into a villager. Starting in 2.8, this is slightly easier if you have wood, as the boats have been converted to their newer vanilla counterparts by the addition of Et Futuurum Requiem. (Make sure the sky is blocked so he does not burn during the day!)

![](../assets/images/gog-zombie-villager.png)

If you donâ€™t get the villager you want (sapling trade, glass trade, clay trade, or wand trade), this is ok. Use the questbook to get a cookie and craft a Mystery Arrow. Place a dispenser into the villager chamber and take a backup. Now add your Mystery Arrow and activate the dispenser using a redstone torch (redstone and sticks are drops from witches, and torches are drops from a certain type of creeper if you canâ€™t get sticks). 

From there, you can either use the raw ore clusters from the pechs to make doors, and a full-on villager breeder, or otherwise restore your backup until you get the type of villager you want (a farmer with a vanilla sapling trade or Forestry lumberjack, which has a guaranteed sapling trade, whether it's first or third, and said sapling may also need to be grown in anything from a 1 by 1 to a 4 by 4.). Congratulations, youâ€™ve entered the **Wood Age!**

# The Wood Age

![Sampsa celebrating wood age in 2022 run](../assets/images/gog-sampsa-woodage.png)

Your goal in the Wood Age is to obtain XP bucket crafting. This will give you access to a wide variety of metal dusts and important resources (eg sulfur dust). There are two methods:

### The shorter / modern method (seared tank):

1. Obtain apothecary villager trade for clay and craft seared tank (make sure `GenerateApothecaries=true` in `witchery.cfg`)
2. Build XP drain
3. Bucket XP from the filled XP drain

The longer / older method (RC tank):

1. Obtain iron from raw ore clusters from pechs and iron ingot drops from zombies, or brutish mobs, which you will use for RC tank and cropsticks.
2. Build an XP drain and an RC tank to hold the XP (this requires a lot of iron)
3. Crossbreed IC2 crops, or, again, use raw ore clusters for the bronze you need for the RC tank valve (copper + tin oreberry)

The shorter / modern method is pretty straightforward, so I will not cover it here. To save a considerable amount of space (10 pages) in this doc, I moved the older / longer method to a separate doc, which can be found at [Wood Age Mob Farm Design](mob_farm_design.md).

When trying to obtain XP oreberries, we recommend going on the red mushroom -> reed -> stickreed -> oreberries route, then breeding the oreberries from there. Alternatively, you can obtain an oreberry from completing the smeltery quest in Multiblock Madness, but that requires a LOT of sand, clay, and gravel.

# Using Stone Age Thaum to reach LV from XP Buckets

Now you can make a BBF, so do that ðŸ™‚

To start making LV circuits, you need vacuum tubes. To do this, you will need a ball mould, which you can only make in a TC smeltery. **So how do you get lava?**

We can obtain lava by centrifuging Simmering Combs. But youâ€™re pre-LV and therefore have no LV centrifuge. Fortunately, we have a saviour in a meme item:

![](../assets/images/gog-hobbyist-steam-engine.png)

Yes - the **Hobbyist Steam Engine** (HSE) is finally useful! We can use a **Forestry Centrifuge** (as it also does not require LV circuits) and RF from the HSE to process our simmering combs. Simmering Combs can be obtained as a trade from Bee Keeper villagers. Each Bee Keeper can trade [only one possible type of comb](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/ForestryMC/blob/c89b61682a9ef389edc68932fce39050d0e76d3e/src/main/java/forestry/apiculture/VillageHandlerApiculture.java#L54), so if a bee keeper tries to sell you Dripping Combs, you know they won't offer you Simmering Combs in future trades, either.

Alternatively, you can obtain Simmering Combs as a drop from a nether hive, which can be bought from the questbook, or as an output from the Transmutating Bee, if you're into bee breeding. As the beekeeper's trades can easily be locked by requesting something unattainable, these are good to keep in mind.

To craft the HSE, you need lapis lazuli plates. Normally you would look to IC2 crops to solve this problem, but the IC2 Lazulia crop requires a lapis block or lapis ore, so weâ€™re back where we started.

![](../assets/images/gog-lazulia-ic2-crop.png)

Fortunately, this problem is solvable - there is a magical crop that drops lapis lazuli! But we still have to make it...

![](../assets/images/gog-lazullia-thaum.png)

# Thaumcraft Research

Thaumcraft progression at this point is very awkward, so weâ€™ll pull some tricks from [Stone Age Thaumcraft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF9HJPsaJasY_V_3OeJOX5RIRzGx5Xjfr-iBzzjfZGU/edit). In particular, we can obtain a profane wand from a heretic villager, or a wand drop from killing a Pech Mage, and we can get a bookshelf trade from a librarian villager. This allows us to obtain a **Thaumonomicon**. We can also obtain **Scribing Tools**:

1. Feathers (drops from chickens and some sniper skeleton mobs)
2. Ink sacs (squid spawns - should happen quite fast in a void world)
3. Glass bottle (drops from witches)
4. Rubber round (rubber is craftable from XP buckets and steam machines)

With these two tools and paper from IC2 sugar cane, we can make researches. For Thaumcraft lazullia, you need: 

1. [Thaumic Bases] Metalleat
2. [Thaumic Bases] Basic Plants

(Quick tip: You can bookmark a research, swap worlds to a creative one that has all the Thaumcraft research and aspects by clicking the Cheater's Thaumonomicon, and easily check what aspects you need by placing it in a research table. It won't complete it, but you can minimise making extra aspects until you have a proper source.)

But waitâ€¦ how do you do the research?? You have only a few primals when starting out in your thaumcraft journey, and you donâ€™t have a thaumometer yet. Obtaining a thaumometer requires a diamond lens, which you canâ€™t make until LV post lathe and cutting machine. But we havenâ€™t even made LV circuits yet. Our answer is abusing an obscure mechanic: bonus points. (Alternatively, you can buy knowledge fragments from pechs and Wizard villagers, eating dried zombie brains, by killing a mob with the Elder Wisdom enchant on a weapon, which sometimes gives you the aspects of said mob, such as humanus from villagers, bestia from animals, alienis from eldritch guardians, etc., or from the warp effect, though it is infrequent and pretty slow.) 

![](../assets/images/gog-bonus-points.png)

Ever noticed these annoying shimmers in the top left of the aspects in the research table? Those are actually free research points! Every 30 seconds, each research table in the world will randomly select a block in a roughly 8x8x8 radius and check if it is in the whitelisted bonus points table. Most whitelisted blocks give what you would expect - ignis for lava, aqua for water, terra for cobblestone, etc. If you happen to have a bookcase in radius, any point can be added, even compound points (eg instrumentum).

The bonus point is only spent when you are at 0 stored points for that aspect, and there is only 1 bonus point. This sounds useless, until you realise:

1. Researches can be moved between tables while in progress
2. The bonus points are stored **per table**, which means you can build up one of every point per table (assuming the tables are chunkloaded long enough).

Using this, you are able to complete early research. To unlock new points that you would normally unlock using the thaumometer, just drag the primals onto each other to build the compound aspects. You can follow this chart, which has most aspects (except for the new ones Alastor has added):

![](../assets/images/gog-aspects-chart.png)

You can also try using balanced shard transmutation to get shards later if youâ€™re missing any, or just breed and trade with enough villagers that you get every shard. If you need any help with essentia for alchemy, [check out my spreadsheet on it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Llvu91Vmn4RcCE__lKV8p_MIR9tiaV2URGbkombvlkE/edit#gid=0). When you are making arcane workbench crafts, you need to be careful about how you use the profane wands to avoid warp. There is a guide on the wiki for this: https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Profane_Wand

# Smeltery Batching

![](../assets/images/gog-smeltery.png)

Once you get your lava and your TC smeltery built - be careful with what you put in! You wonâ€™t get infinite trades with the beekeeper villager at this point in the game - some trades require spending princesses or drones, which you really donâ€™t want at this stage. 

Fortunately, the other methods are much more renewable. Buying a nether hive from the qb and then either just using the simmering comb that drops from it, or letting the embittered bee work in the nether, as it requries Flowers: Flowers, not Flowers: Nether. The other way, if you've decided to restrict access to the Nether, is to breed the Transmuting bee.

Fortunately, preserving lava in the TC smeltery is quite simple - it just uses a constant amount of lava when on, regardless of size or which items are currently being burnt. So you just need to make a big smeltery and do a big batch. Compressing metals or using large plates helps you get multiple items done in a single operation. You can see our batch:

![](../assets/images/gog-smeltery-batch.png)

That is:

1. 1 copper block (For aluminium brass.)
2. 5 bronze blocks (For tools)
3. 10 steel blocks (For the gt molds and shapes)
4. 10 aluminium dust (For aluminium brass. From 2.8 and on, replace this with zinc. Alternatively, you can alloy brass in the steam alloy smelter for a better ratio, unlike aluminium brass, which is an mv voltage recipe.)
5. 32 glass dust (For glass blocks for crafting, such as for solar boilers, which make free steam for just some silver, which can be made with xp or as ore clusters from the pechs. You can skip this as it has a recipe in the alloy smelter.)
6. 1 block + 7 alumite ingots (For making a tool forge)
7. 16 large stone plates (For the two seared stone blocks, one for the casting table, the other for the tool forge)

Congrats! Once you process this batch, youâ€™re all ready to get a ball mold and enter LV.
